## System Architecture
The platform is built with a React frontend (TypeScript, shadcn/ui, Wouter), a Node.js Express backend, and a PostgreSQL database utilizing Drizzle ORM. Core functionalities include:
- **UI/UX**: Clean, production-ready design using shadcn/ui components.
- **Authentication**: Simplified authentication for Facebook account management.
- **Data Management**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for robust data handling.
- **Facebook Integration**: Deep integration with Meta Graph API for publishing, account management, and real-time analytics.
- **Content Scheduling**: Supports bulk post scheduling via Excel/CSV import with advanced date/time parsing and timezone management (IST to UTC conversion).
- **Media Handling**: Comprehensive system for media upload (images, videos), including:
    - Support for large video files via Facebook's resumable upload API (up to 1.75GB).
    - Intelligent upload method selection, prioritizing actual video file uploads over link posts.
    - Quality-preserving video processing, maintaining original video quality.
    - Integration of FFmpeg for high-quality video processing (e.g., 1080p60 YouTube downloads with audio merging).
- **Customization**: Custom labeling system compatible with Meta Insights for advanced reporting.
- **Reliability**: Robust scheduling service with database-driven intervals (15 seconds) that survives server restarts and prevents Replit sleep mode through self-pinging and external monitoring.
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error detection, retry logic with exponential backoff for database operations, and graceful handling of API errors and network issues.
- **Content Preservation**: Ensures original user-provided content is preserved across all upload methods (manual, CSV, video).
- **Security**: Virus scan bypass for Google Drive downloads and intelligent transformation of custom labels to avoid Facebook username restrictions.
