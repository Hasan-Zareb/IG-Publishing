# Google Drive Video Upload Solution

## Python-Style Downloader Implemented âœ…

I've implemented the exact Google Drive download approach from your Python script:

### Key Features:
1. **Confirmation Token Handling** - Extracts tokens from Google Drive's download form
2. **Session Management** - Maintains cookies across requests like your script
3. **Two-Phase Download** - Initial request + confirmation request with tokens
4. **HTML Error Detection** - Identifies when Google Drive returns error pages
5. **Progress Tracking** - Shows download progress during large file transfers

### Current Test:
- **Post ID 292** updated with proper Google Drive sharing URL format
- **File ID**: `1Fl_HSrPtUiIPeNpaGJNrZ_nQc2iWhFz6` 
- **URL Format**: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`
- **Status**: Scheduled to test in ~2 minutes using Python-style downloader

### What the System Does:
1. Extracts file ID from Google Drive URL (like your script)
2. Makes initial request to get confirmation tokens
3. Parses HTML form using Cheerio (like BeautifulSoup)
4. Makes confirmed download request with proper cookies
5. Validates response content type and size
6. Downloads video file with progress tracking
7. Uploads actual video file to Facebook (not link post)

### Next Steps:
The system will automatically test the Python-style downloader when the scheduled post runs. If the Google Drive file is properly shared with "Anyone with the link" permissions, it should download and upload successfully to Facebook.

**Status**: Waiting for scheduled test execution to verify Python-style approach works with your Google Drive files.
