Add a two-level login with clear, simple screens and rules:

Goal

Have two types of sign-in: Admin and User.

Show who scheduled each post.

Make sure Admins see everything, and Users only see their own work.

What to add

Sign-in & account basics

Add a sign-in page (email + password).

After sign-in, show the person’s name and role (Admin/User) in the header, with a Logout option.

If a person is deactivated, they cannot sign in and should see a friendly message.

Admin experience

Add a Users page in the menu (only Admins can see it).

On the Users page, an Admin can:

Create a new team user (name, email). Show a temporary password the Admin can copy and share.

Reset a user’s password (show a new temporary password).

Deactivate/Reactivate a user.

Optionally change a user’s role (User ↔ Admin).

In Reports and Upcoming Posts pages:

Show all posts from the whole team.

Add a column called “Scheduled by” showing the person’s name who scheduled it.

Add a simple filter at the top to view posts by a specific user or show “All users”.

User experience

Users do not see the Users page.

In Reports and Upcoming Posts, show only the posts that this logged-in User scheduled.

Keep the “Scheduled by” column (it will show their own name).

When scheduling posts (manual or CSV)

The system must automatically record who is scheduling (use the currently signed-in person).

Do not let anyone choose another person’s name during scheduling.

Keep all existing scheduling and publishing behavior the same—no changes to how posts are published, just record who scheduled them.

What to display in Reports/Upcoming

Keep the current columns.

Add “Scheduled by” (person’s name).

Admins can filter by user; Users cannot (they already see only their own posts).

Success checklist (must work end-to-end)

An Admin can sign in, open Users, create a User, reset passwords, and deactivate/reactivate users.

A newly created User can sign in with the temporary password and then set a new one.

When a User schedules posts (by hand or CSV), those posts show up in their Upcoming and Reports, and do not appear for other Users.

Admins see all posts with the “Scheduled by” name filled in.

Deactivated users cannot sign in.

Existing publishing flows still work as before.

Keep it simple

Use the current design style.

Show clear messages (e.g., “Wrong email or password”, “Your account is deactivated”).

Do not change any Facebook upload logic—just add sign-in, the Users page for Admins, and the “Scheduled by” visibility rules.
